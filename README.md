# CurrencyConverter
========================================

Android application converting currencies.

If no internet connection is available, the application will use the latest fx rates downloaded previously.

I use the official rates provided by the European Central Bank available [here](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html) and updated everyday.

For the visualization of the last 90 days, I use the chart library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)
